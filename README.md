# yelpcamp

A vanilla JS website for campgrounds all around the world in a Yelp-like fashion. Users can create an account, add campgrounds and edit them. Users can also view the campgrounds other users have created, and leave reviews.

## Tech Stack:

**Front End:**

- CSS
- Javascript

**Back End:**

- Node.js
- Express
- MongoDB

## Key Endeavors

- Build a Full Stack Web Application without the use of a JS framework.
- Make a simple, elegant, and responsive design.
- Use MongoDB to practice NoSQL.
- Add authentication and other security features.

While I enjoy building projects with React, the framework abstracts away a lot of what is going on behind the scenes. React will be with us for many more years, but I doubt it will outlast JS and developers can be asked to work on a new framework, and so I believe it is important to practice our JS skills to keep them sharp and enable us to transition to new projects seamlessly.

There is a rise in the use of NoSQL, and I wanted to improve my abilities by using MongoDB and Mongoose for this project. I still prefer to use SQL technologies to build larger and more complex projects, but MongoDB was a great choice to quickly build an MVP.

## Local installation

1. Install all dependencies with `npm install`.

2. `nodemon start` to start the server and then you can access the website with localhost.
